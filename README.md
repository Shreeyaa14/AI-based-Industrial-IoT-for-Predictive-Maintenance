# AI-based-Industrial-IoT-for-Predictive-Maintenance
AI-based Industrial IoT for Predictive Maintenance is a system in which vibration patterns are detected in machines and are displayed with the number of vibrations and the intensity of vibrations in dashboard. This displayed data analyses its working efficiency and is transferred to Vertex AI to predict the chances of industrial machine failure.

Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) for Predictive Maintenance is a powerful application that leverages data from connected industrial equipment to predict when maintenance is required before a failure occurs. This proactive approach helps organizations minimize downtime, reduce maintenance costs, and optimize overall operational efficiency. the proposed model of Industrial IoT for Predictive Maintenance is highly efficient when compared to existing model in terms of Speed, Memory Storage, Easy and Accurate Prediction of failed machine in the industry containing large number of machines. As industries strive for greater efficiency and reliability, the project of Industrial IoT for Predictive Maintenance is highly a demanded project for the society in the aspects of industrial purpose.
Hardware Components: Vibration Sensor, IoT Device - ESP32

METHODOLOGY
* The Data of the Machine’s Working Status and Efficiency is collected by IoT Devices and Sensors connected to each of the machine in the industry. This can be acquired by the detection of vibration pattern of the machine.
* Master Monitor Gateway serves as a centralized control point for monitoring and managing various sensors and devices across the industrial environment.
* The Data collected is then stored in the Cloud Storage.
* The Data is then transferred to Vertex AI where the Prediction is done using AI Networking Mechanism and thus it provides the information about which machine has the highest chances of getting failure and service has to be done.
* The Predicted Data is Analyzed and Structured according to the details which has to be placed in output.
* Finally, the output is displayed in a webpage in the form of Dashboard .
